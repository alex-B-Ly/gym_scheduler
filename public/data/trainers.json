    "bio": "Fitness has been part of my life since I was very young, I was always very involved in many different sports and martial arts. It wasn't until my senior year of high school that I realized I could help others with their fitness goals instead of my own and became very passionate about it. I went to Towson University for a semester and spent more time in the gym working out and exploring fitness. I would even join the ROTC kids on early morning runs and track work outs for fun. I decided to leave Towson and go to RVCC for exercise science. I enjoy learning new things involving fitness and believe that fitness can be fun as well as effective, you just need to find a work out that is right for you because we are all different physically and mentally. My goal is to help people find a way to enjoy exercise and motivate them towards their fitness goals.",
